# Algo Visualizer

Website created as part of GSG's React training third learning sprint.


a simple site featuring the visualization of three sorting algorithms which are bubble sort, insertion sort and selection sort, built using HTML and CSS and JS.


## Features

- Simple Design.
- Live preview.
- Ability of changing the sample size upto 100.
- Randomizing the sample value.
- Speed up or down the animation.
- Smooth transition of algorithms.
- Capability of adding more algorithms.



## Usage/Examples
Randomize the values of the sample then click on the visualize button, or you can change the size of the sample, the sort algorithm or its speed then visualize it.
